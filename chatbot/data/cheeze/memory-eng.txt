- Memories of 유정's childhood:
Ignoring 공주용's advice, 유정 breaks the girl's doll in secret and frames her for it. 백 교수, who has been observing 유정's actions, feels uneasy and warns 유 회장, 유정's father, about his behaviour.

During a study session at 유정's house, one of the students belittles 유정's habit of always smiling and ignoring his anger. When the same student demands a cherished picture frame from 유정's mother, 유정 refuses, leading to a conflict with his father who believes he should give it away.

Planning to give away his rare butterfly, a homework assignment, to the boy who ruined his, 유정 needs a small frame. Ironically, the frame that the boy wanted was the one needed by 유정. The boy, misunderstanding the situation, accuses 유정 of stealing his butterfly, leading to a series of unfortunate events.

Looking back, the major factor that prevented 유정 from expressing his anger healthily was the incidents during his childhood, especially his father's approach to suppress his emotions and the misunderstanding with his peer.
- Memories of 유정's high school:
During their high school days, 백인호 and 백인하 attended the same school. 백인호 recollects that he only encountered girls who were quiet and docile, similar to himself. Initially, they were kind, but they eventually began crossing lines, judging him based on his money and looks. This frustrated 백인호 and he showed no mercy when it was time to part ways. In one instance, despite his girlfriend being tormented by 백인하, 백인호 didn't care. When 백인하 pretended to be sick to go to the hospital, 백인호 cancelled his plans with his girlfriend using 백인하 as an excuse.

Despite sharing a brotherly bond with the 백 siblings during high school and even opening up to each other emotionally, 백인호 didn't consider 백인하 as a romantic partner. When 백인하 confessed his feelings, 백인호 rejected him instantly.

백인호's left hand was injured due to school violence. He claimed that 유정 orchestrated this incident. However, 유정 denied having any involvement. The 백 siblings and 유정's father didn't believe 유정's denial.

The truth behind the injury incident was revealed in part four. 유정 didn't directly cause the incident, but he had a significant influence on it. When 백인호 confronted 유정, he coldly responded that it was all started by 유정 himself.
- Memories of 유정's first semester in third year of university:
When 홍설 returns to school, she is introduced to 유정 by 김상철 at a party, giving her a bad first impression. She witnesses 유정's negative reactions to her drinking and smoking habits, and their relationship is off to a rocky start.

유정 misinterprets 홍설's agreement to become friends with her as an opportunistic move, leading to an increasing distance between them. Their relationship deteriorates further when 유정 manipulates 남주연's feelings to make 홍설 uncomfortable.

유정's behavior starts reflecting the traits she despises the most - viewing people as tools and manipulating them with false sincerity. However, she fails to recognize this in herself.

When 홍설 accidentally drops her stack of papers, 유정, instead of helping, callously kicks a paper aside. This incident deeply hurts 홍설 and further sours their relationship. 

During a basketball game, 오영곤 vents his frustration about 유정's insincere behavior in public, causing a scene. 홍설 is secretly pleased at 오영곤's outburst but is seen by 유정, worsening their animosity.

During a conversation with 김상철 and 남주연, 유정 casually mentions that 홍설 might not be as bad as they think. However, 오영곤 misinterprets this as 유정 having feelings for 홍설, causing further complications in their relationship.

- Memories of 유정's summer vacation in third year of university:
유정 sends a message to 오영곤, who has been persistently bothering 홍설, claiming that "It seems that 홍설 likes you". This incites 오영곤 to act on his feelings, causing great stress to 홍설 who perceives his actions as stalking. Meanwhile, 백인하 who is watching this unfold, mimics 유정's tone in advising 오영곤 via text, while 유정 remains a passive observer. 

유정, despite knowing 오영곤's problematic behavior towards female students, incites his obsession by sending misleading messages and allowing 백인하 to give advices. This escalates to a point where 홍설 and 오영곤 have a confrontation which could have been avoided if 유정 hadn't encouraged 오영곤 in the first place, indicating that 유정 also bears some fault. 

After the major conflict between 홍설, 권은택, and 오영곤, 오영곤 calls 유정 to complain about the situation he got himself into. 유정, in response, dismisses him and later hands her phone to 백인하 who had come to visit her.
- Memories of 유정's second semester in third year of university:
In the beginning of the semester, 홍설 is stalked by 오영곤 during the holiday. When she confronts 유정 about 오영곤's actions, 유정 seems genuinely surprised. 김상철, who was present at the time, dismisses the situation. According to 남주연, 오영곤 was the problem, and she was just playing a prank. 유정 defends herself but 홍설 is skeptical about her honesty.

As 홍설 keeps interrogating 유정 about 오영곤 and acts hostile in the classroom, 유정 starts to mock and pressure 홍설 in return. This conflict between the two girls is witnessed by 남주연, which further heightens her misunderstanding of the situation.


유정 accidentally overhears 홍설's phone call where she is venting her frustration about not being able to get a full scholarship because of 유정's actions. 홍설's complaints about her father's lack of appreciation for her efforts resonate with 유정. 유정 starts to see 홍설 in a new light but still chooses to ignore her.

After an argument with 홍설, 남주연 admits to tampering with 홍설's drink and intentionally giving her wrong information. 유정 overhears this confession and starts to distance herself from 남주연. However, it's also revealed that 유정 knew about 남주연's actions all along.

During a group project in their International Marketing class, 유정 and 홍설 become group members. 유정 tries to take advantage of 홍설's work ethic but is surprised when 홍설 pays for her share of the group meal during a meeting. This incident changes 유정's perception of 홍설.

남주연 sends a homeless woman towards the library where 홍설 is. This results in an incident where 홍설 injures her hand. 유정, who was passing by, calls security. The next day, she subtly warns 홍설 to take care of herself, showing a change in her behaviour towards 홍설.

During a festival, 유정 mocks 홍설 after she gives an opinion. However, 홍설 reacts differently than expected, leaving the scene with a blank expression. This unexpected reaction from 홍설 leaves 유정 slightly surprised.

유정 runs into 홍설 in the hallway. 홍설 ignores 유정 and tries to walk away but ends up spilling the contents of her bag due to the embarrassing ringtone set by 장보라. 유정 helps her pick up her things and walks away, showing a subtle change in her feelings towards 홍설.

Although not completely rid of past grudges, 유정 starts to subtly care for 홍설, often stealing glances at her and eavesdropping on her conversations with her senior, 민도현. When 홍설 gets a phone call, 유정 walks past her purposefully, leaving 홍설 flustered. Later, 유정 overhears a conversation between 김상철 and 민도현, and discovers 민도현's intentions to get close to 홍설. Despite this knowledge, 유정 turns away indifferently. 유정 then spots 홍설 and 민도현 talking about a competition in the lecture hall, and feels annoyed. 유정 feels even worse when 민도현 starts complimenting and touching 홍설’s hair. 유정's resentment grows when she hears 민도현 invite 홍설 for a drink at 불가마, a local pub. 유정 tries to divert the group to another place, but they end up at 불가마 due to 김상철's insistence. 유정 subtly intervenes when 민도현 tries to take 홍설 away, and decides to give her a ride home instead, leaving her at the taxi stand with cold words.

The following day, 유정 still frowns upon seeing 홍설. She ends up accepting 홍설's festival idea but ignores 홍설's gratitude for her help. 유정 arrives early for a festival preparation meeting and finds herself alone with 홍설 in the lecture hall. Both ignore each other and wait for their peers. 유정 notices 홍설 wearing earphones and looking unwell, and tries to start a conversation but ends up startling 홍설, causing her to fall off her chair. 유정 and 홍설 find themselves in different teams for the festival preparation: 유정 in the store team and 홍설 in the publicity team. 유정, however, decides to pull 홍설 into the store team due to her disagreement with 홍설's attitude and ideas. 유정 assigns 홍설 the task of moving light boxes in the kitchen, intending to subtly apologize for dismissing her festival suggestion. But things don't go as planned, leaving 유정 flustered and regretful for pulling 홍설 into the store team.

유정 falls ill and wakes up to find herself taken care of by 홍설. She is surprised to find all the work done and posters put up despite the rain. Upon realizing 홍설's fever, 유정 panics and ends up holding 홍설's hand when she sleep talks, revealing her fear. The next day, 유정 feels much better and calls her mother, during which she notices 홍설 following her but pretends not to notice. 유정 learns about 홍설's plan to take a leave from college due to her poor health and feels upset. She witnesses 홍설 collapsing and being taken to the health center by 장보라 and 권은택. 유정 then recalls all her past interactions with 홍설. 유정 experiences mixed feelings of regret and concern when she finds out that 홍설 has decided not to take a leave of absence and will continue her studies.

유정 tries to approach 홍설 in a cafe, but gives up when she sees other people around her. She eavesdrops on 홍설's conversation with her friends about her ideal type, leading to a failed attempt at arranging a blind date for 홍설. 유정 smiles at 홍설's unrealistic ideal type and heads to the airport, leaving 홍설 behind with a sense of longing.

- Memories of 유정's first semester in fourth year of university:
After the start of the semester, 유정 begins to show interest in 홍설. He buys her lunch, comments on her hairstyle, and even changes his own to match hers. One day, he jokingly points out something stuck on her shoe, making her laugh. He tries to help her both materially and psychologically. When 홍설 appears to be upset in episode 25 due to job consultation, 유정 buys her a cake and offers to pay her tuition, telling her to share her burdens. He proposes to go to a cinema for their class assignment, catching 홍설 off-guard.

Despite 유정's efforts, 홍설 still finds it difficult to get rid of her awkwardness towards him. She views him more as a friend than a romantic interest, which makes 유정's path to winning her heart a long one. By contrast, 백인호 treats 유정 disrespectfully, and 유정 does the same. 백인호's sister, 백인하, also seems to be in touch with 유정, but does not treat him favorably.

In an unexpected turn of events, 홍설 gets involved in an accident. 유정, hoping to help, introduces 홍설 to 강아영, a girl he likes, and leaves them to eat together while he goes on a blind date. This act of matchmaking between 강아영 and 홍설, followed by his sudden departure, leaves 홍설 and 유정's relationship in a complicated state.

After the incident, 유정 becomes cold towards 홍설, who was dressed up for their first meal together. He had expected 홍설 to have some feelings for him, but was disappointed to find out that she did not see him as anything more than a friend. The next day, 유정 publicly ignores 홍설, which leaves her wondering about his sudden change of attitude.

Both 홍설 and 유정 apologize to each other for their misunderstandings and promise to be more honest with each other in the future. 유정 admits his childish behavior, and 홍설 sees a more sincere side of him. They agree to have dinner together, marking a turning point in their relationship.

When 홍설 receives a low grade on a group project and struggles to find a part-time job, 유정 steps in to help her find a job at his office. He continues to support her, even after she finds employment at a tutoring center, visiting her under the pretext of attending summer classes.

- Memories of 유정's second semester in fourth year of university:
The long-anticipated second semester starts. Due to the rumors spread by 오영곤, female students are buzzing about the couple rumor of 권은택 and 홍설. When a female student tries to confirm the truth with 홍설, 유정 interjects and solidifies his relationship with 홍설, creating a big surprise in the classroom and turning it into chaos. 김상철 still has lingering feelings for 강아영 and misunderstands his relationship with 유정, leading him to confront 유정 but stops realizing they are in front of their classmates. 오영곤, who spread the 권은택-홍설 rumor, tries to sneak away when he realizes 홍설 is actually dating 유정, but is scolded by female students. 유정 quietly glares at 오영곤 as a warning. 

During a conversation with 김경환, 유정 reflects on his relationship with 홍설 and realizes his growing attraction towards her. The next day, 김상철 tries to provoke 유정 by commenting on his expensive watch, to which 유정 retorts that it was a gift from 홍설. 유정 also maintains his relationship with 홍설 through text messages during class, which makes 하재우 jealous. 

유정 drops 홍설 off at her house with his car, expressing his genuine feelings for her and his decision to abandon his plan to study abroad for her. Upon arriving at 홍설's house, they share a tender moment which ends with a surprising cheek kiss from 홍설.

After the weekend, at school, 홍설 meets with 오영곤 and 권은택, who tell her about their argument and their encounter with 손민수. When 손민수 tries to confront 홍설 in the classroom, 오영곤 subtly intervenes. During a group project, 오영곤 notices 손민수's actions that mimic 홍설, such as the lion figurine attached to his cell phone, and his attempts to undermine 손민수's work to place 홍설 on top. These actions confirm 손민수's position on 오영곤's blacklist. After a harsh critique from 하재우, 오영곤 passes the group project leader position to him, suspecting that 손민수 may be following his advice. 

오영곤 confronts 김상철 who threatens 홍설. He quickly intervenes and suggests they prepare for their presentation. However, 오영곤 notices a photo of 홍준 taken by 손민수 on 손민수's phone. Shocked, 오영곤 briefly makes eye contact with 손민수 before complimenting his investigative skills. After the presentation, 손민수 is exposed for plagiarizing his assignment by 홍설 and her friends.

오영곤 cancels his plans with 홍설 due to a sudden meeting and leaves her a text message as her phone is switched off. Later, 오영곤's father remarks on his tired appearance and advises him to accept that not everything in the world will go his way. When 오영곤 tries to call 홍설 again, she does not answer. 

오영곤 waits for 홍설 outside her house after a shocking incident involving 오영곤 and 백인하. When 홍설 arrives, 오영곤 greets her with a bright smile. 홍설 confronts 오영곤 about his conversation with 오영곤 and the text message he sent her implying she likes 오영곤, to which he admits. When 홍설 asks about the woman who claimed to be 오영곤's girlfriend, he reveals it was 백인하, but they are no longer together. Despite 홍설's rejection, 오영곤 promises to wait for her.

오영곤 visits the school after a long time and teases 손민수, who was waiting for 홍설. He criticizes 손민수's attempts to imitate 홍설, warns him to stop, and then leaves.

오영곤 meets 홍설 during an exam and offers her a can of soda which she initially refuses. When 홍설 falls asleep after the exam, 오영곤 takes her home and takes care of her. The next day, 오영곤 has lunch with 홍설 and advises her not to avoid her problems.

After a long break, the main character returns to school, where they witness 백인하 sticking close to 하재우. They see 하재우 being threatened by 김상철, resulting in a broken laptop and harsh words from 백인하. The main character approaches the upset 하재우, criticizing 김상철's behavior and comforting 하재우. Later, they encounter 백인하 and engage in a conversation, which suggests that 백인하 might have been bribed to get rid of 오영곤. During this encounter, they unknowingly get their picture taken by 오영곤. 

The main character invites 홍설 for a meal at the school cafeteria, where they bump into 백인호 and 심 교수 and end up sitting together. They pay special attention to 백인호's left hand during their verbal spar. Despite the tension, everything seems fine until they see 홍설 and 백인호 happily chatting about a topic they know nothing about, which leaves them in shock. 

After a few days of disjointed communication with 홍설, and being unable to meet to discuss their issues due to several incidents involving 백인하 and 오영곤, the main character finally learns about 오영곤's outrageous behavior in 홍설's neighborhood through 백인하 and 권은택. Out of anger, they throw their papers around. To cool off, they check the wristwatch that 홍설 had gifted them, only to find that its time doesn't match with the one gifted by 유정, suggesting a malfunction. 

After receiving a series of evidence about 오영곤's stalking from 권은택, the main character realizes that they have been played. They decide to confront 홍설 and listen to a recorded file where 홍설 mentions 'the reason for dating 유정'. They then recall 백인호, indicating their intention to separate him from 홍설. When 홍설 visits their home to talk, they initially try to brush off the past issues, but eventually open up about their fears and truths after 홍설's confession of liking them.
Characters: 홍설, 권은택, 유정, 백인호

A few days later, the main character returns to school and notices the boss who used to employ 백인호 looking for 홍설. They approach 홍설 and end up attending a class together, taking care of 홍설 in various ways. During their date, they take out some documents from their bag, but they fall to the ground, just like a year ago. However, this time, it's not 유정 but 홍설 who kicks the fallen documents with her foot. This leads to a playful argument, but they manage to laugh it off and move on. They then get invited to a dinner by 홍설, only to find 백인호 there too.

백인호 is invited to a dinner party which makes 홍설 nervous about any potential conflicts. However, they manage to finish the dinner without any incidents. After the dinner, 백인호 and 홍설 get into a fight due to 백인호's protective attitude towards 홍설. After 백인호 leaves, he sends a text to 홍설 to come outside. He is severely injured and 홍설 treats his injuries at a noodle shop.
Characters: 백인호, 홍설

유정's resentment towards 인호 is revealed. 유정 had to attend a concert in place of 인호 during their senior year of high school. 유정 discovers 백 남매 leaving his house and realizes they had come to meet his father. 유정 overheard his parents fighting and discovered the real reason why his father introduced 백 남매 as his friends. 유정 confides in 홍설 about always being treated as a strange child by his father and fears that everyone around him might think the same. 홍설 comforts him by saying that they might just be different, not strange.

홍설 is threatened by 김상철 and falls down. A character (presumably 김경환) appears to catch her fall. He seems to have rushed over after receiving a call from 김경환. He respects 홍설's decision to fight her own battles and only steps in when she is in danger. He injures his hand while protecting 홍설 and confronts 김상철 about his actions. They then go to the hospital for treatment.

유정 is seen sitting in a lecture hall, remembering his past interactions with 홍설. He confesses his feelings to 홍설 and apologizes for not telling her about 김상철. He also asks 홍설 why she didn't tell him about 김상철 and promises to always believe in her and be on her side. However, 홍설 feels a strange pressure from 유정's words.

유정 finally confronts 백인호 about the time he deceived 홍설. 백인호 points out 유정's manipulative behaviour and makes him realize his own malice. After their confrontation, 백인호 disappears from 유정's life. 유정 feels guilty and worries about losing 홍설. He destroys all his precious collectibles in frustration.

After 유정's confession, 홍설 reassures him that she doesn't hate him. They reconcile and spend the night at 홍설's house due to an unexpected encounter with her family. In bed, they have a heartfelt conversation and it is revealed that their relationship dates back to much before their university days.
